# Project Title
Summer Chores

## Description
This project is an example of how to deal with asynchrounous code using callback functions.  Speficially, the setTimeout function is utilized to simulate the length of certain functions and the callback function is used to ensure they execute in the correct order.

The second javascript document = promisesVersion - achieves the same result as the more cumbersome callback version but in a cleaner and easier to read manner.
